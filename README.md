# Image Caption Generator
This repository contains an image caption generator that generates textual descriptions for images using deep learning techniques. The system combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate meaningful and accurate captions for a wide range of images.

# Features
## Deep Learning Model:
The image caption generator utilizes a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of images and corresponding captions. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for generating captions.

## Preprocessing Pipeline:
The repository provides a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline for preparing the input images and captions. It includes image resizing, normalization, and tokenization of captions to create suitable training data for the model.

## Training and Evaluation: 
The repository includes scripts for training the image caption generator model on custom or pre-trained datasets. It also provides evaluation tools to measure the performance of the model in terms of caption accuracy, BLEU scores, and other metrics.

## Inference and Caption Generation:
Once trained, the model can be used to generate captions for new images. The repository provides inference scripts and examples to showcase how to use the trained model to generate captions for unseen images.
